# Project Description
Tasks that labourers in the agriculture industry commonly perform, including
carrying heavy loads and bending down, are among the worst for workplace health
and safety. This project addresses the need for a versatile, adaptable mobile
platform to assist in transportation of heavy loads in these agricultural
settings. A quadrupedal robot is being developed to solve this problem, as it
provides a highly maneuverable, stable platform that is capable of traversing
uneven terrain.
