## Chasis Build Completed

Today the team completed the first build of the chasis for the robot. It is constructed out of machined 8020 aluminum extrusion.

As can be seen in the photo above, the ODrives were also connected onto two laser jet cut polycarbonate plates. The battery was also placed into the chasis and the breaker was installed onto the side of the chasis.
